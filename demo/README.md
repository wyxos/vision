# @wyxos/vision Demo

This demo showcases the usage of the FormBuilder and Listing utilities from the @wyxos/vision package.

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, use the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run demo
```

This will start a Vite development server, and you can access the demo in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Demo Features

### FormBuilder Demo

The FormBuilder demo shows how to:

- Create a form with initial values
- Validate form fields
- Display validation errors
- Submit form data to an API
- Reset the form to its initial state
- Track form submission state (loading, success, error)

### Listing Demo

The Listing demo shows how to:

- Create a listing with pagination
- Load data from an API
- Filter data
- Navigate between pages
- Transform query parameters for API compatibility
- Display loading states
- View detailed information for list items

## Implementation Details

The demo uses:

- Vue 3 Composition API
- JSONPlaceholder as a mock API
- Vite as the development server

The components in this demo are designed to be simple examples that demonstrate the core functionality of the @wyxos/vision utilities. In a real application, you would likely have more complex forms and listings with additional features.
